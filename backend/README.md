Welcome on The Beautiful Game

# What is it ? 

The first Platform for Amateur Ballers to catch up to play football. You want to play an awesome game of football and can't find enough friends ? Just post your match information on TBG and people will show up.
Football is a game for everyone so no one on TBG should care about age, skill-level, ethnicity or gender. After the game you can catch up and vote on each others playing style. Enjoy it.
